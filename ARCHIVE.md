# Project Archived — December 2025

This repository is now archived and kept for historical and educational purposes.

## Why This Project Was Archived
- The concept remained niche and didn’t build a sustainable audience.
- Modern AI-based music generation requires substantial computational resources that are not practical to maintain for a hobby project.
- No clear path emerged to evolve the idea into a competitive or meaningful application in 2024–2025.
- Personal priorities shifted to other active projects.

## What Remains Available
- Full source code of the original project.
- A guide for local usage in `RUNLOCALLY.md`.
- All previously generated music tracks (some of which are available on YouTube).

## Notes
This archive is not intended for further development.  
Feel free to explore, fork, or reuse parts of the code for your own experiments.
