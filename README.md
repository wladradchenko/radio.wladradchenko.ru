<b>Status</b>: ARCHIVED. The project is no longer supported (Dec 2025). This repository is an archive of the pet project, "Neural Radio." The project will remain available as code, but I don't plan to further develop or support it. The reasons are: the niche nature of the idea, the increasing resource demands of neural networks in music generation, and the lack of a sustainable, competitive idea for development and growth. I thank everyone who showed interest in the project, provided feedback, and supported it with donations, subscribed to the channel, commented and even ordered music tracks. If you'd like to launch it locally, please find the instructions in `RUNLOCALLY.md`.

All music in the project was generated by custom neural network through prompts, and some is available on [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJG0sD6007zFBhVunDaNQXzJ4LC3q4NTy).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Infinite Neural Radio is a web shell project that allows users to listen to a personalized collection of lofi music (which is created by the neural network [Audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft)) as well as some radio stations and occasionally enjoy voice of a radio host based on a neural network generated in the application [Wunjo](https://github.com/wladradchenko/wunjo.wladradchenko.ru).

The goal of the project is to create non-stop musical compositions and a podcast for comfortable work, leisure and evening time.

The back-end of the platform is built on Go, while the front-end is implemented in JavaScript using AJAX, which provides a convenient and intuitive user interface.

In addition, the project offers a PWA app that users can install on their phones to access endless neural radio and change tracks on the go. Whether you're a fan of lofi music, neural networks, or both, Infinite Neural Radio offers a new and fun way to discover and enjoy new sounds.

Also, I would like to note that gif animation, quotes, podcast text are also created by neural networks. [English](https://radio.wladradchenko.ru/eng) and [Russian version](https://radio.wladradchenko.ru)
